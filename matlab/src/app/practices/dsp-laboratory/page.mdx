# MATLAB as a DSP Laboratory

Think of MATLAB not as a programming language but as a digital oscilloscope, spectrum analyzer, and signal generator combined:

| Instrument         | MATLAB Equivalent                 | Function                                |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Oscilloscope       | `plot(t, signal)`                 | View waveforms                          |
| Spectrum Analyzer  | `periodogram(x, [], [], fs)`      | Frequency analysis                      |
| Function Generator | `sin(2*pi*f*t)`, `chirp(t, ...)`  | Create test signals                     |
| Filter Designer    | `butter`, `fir1`                  | Design filters                          |
| Digital Multimeter | `rms(signal)`, `max(abs(signal))` | Measure signal properties               |
| Lock-in Amplifier  | `filter`, `pwelch`                | Extract signals at specific frequencies |

Use this mindset: "What measurement would I make in the lab?" Then translate to MATLAB code.
