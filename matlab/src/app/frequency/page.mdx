# Motivation: Why Frequency Domain?

Real signals are complex mixtures of frequency components. The time-domain shows _when_ events happen; the frequency-domain shows _what frequencies_ are present and with what amplitude and phase. Filters, noise analysis, and system identification all benefit from frequency-domain thinking.
