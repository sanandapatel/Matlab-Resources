# Why Digital Filters?

Filters separate useful signal from noise. They're essential in:

- Audio/music: equalizers, effect processing
- RF/wireless: channel selection, interference rejection
- Medical: ECG noise removal, EEG artifact suppression
- Instrumentation: sensor data smoothing

Two types:

- **FIR (Finite Impulse Response)**: Impulse response `h[n]` has finite length. Always stable, can have linear phase.
- **IIR (Infinite Impulse Response)**: Uses feedback, impulse response decays over time. More efficient but requires stability checks.
