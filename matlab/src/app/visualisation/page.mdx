# Plotting and Visualisation

### Why Visualization Is Essential in DSP

DSP is fundamentally about understanding signals—and signals are best understood visually. A filter's frequency response, aliasing effects, spectral content—all invisible in raw numbers but instantly clear in a plot. You'll plot constantly: signals before and after filtering, frequency spectra, system responses.
