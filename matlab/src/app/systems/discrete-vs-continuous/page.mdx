# Discrete-Time Signals vs Continuous-Time Signals

Discrete-time signals exist only at sample times, determined by sampling frequency.

```bash filename="discrete_vs_continuous.m" copy
clear all; clc;

% Continuous-time representation (mathematical)
t_cont = 0:0.001:1;  % Very fine resolution (1000 points per second)
x_continuous = sin(2*pi*5*t_cont);

% Discrete-time representation (physical reality)
fs = 50;             % 50 Hz sampling
t_discrete = 0:1/fs:1;
x_discrete = sin(2*pi*5*t_discrete);

figure('Position', [100, 100, 1200, 400]);

subplot(1, 2, 1);
plot(t_cont, x_continuous, 'b-', 'LineWidth', 2);
xlabel('Time (s)');
ylabel('Amplitude');
title('Continuous-Time: High Resolution');
grid on;
xlim([0, 0.5]);

subplot(1, 2, 2);
stem(t_discrete, x_discrete, 'r', 'filled', 'LineWidth', 2);
xlabel('Time (s)');
ylabel('Amplitude');
title(['Discrete-Time: fs = ', num2str(fs), ' Hz']);
grid on;
xlim([0, 0.5]);
```

**Explanation**: Sampling converts continuous signals to discrete samples. The sampling frequency fs determines the spacing between samples. If fs is too low relative to signal frequency, aliasing occurs (a 5 Hz signal sampled at 10 Hz appears as only 2 cycles in 1 second).
