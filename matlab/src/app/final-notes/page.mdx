# Final Notes

This guide presents MATLAB as a **DSP laboratory**. Every concept has a practical code implementation. As an RF engineering student, you'll apply these tools to:
- Characterize circuits (measure S-parameters, impedance)
- Process sensor data (temperature, signal strength)
- Design and test filters for RF applications
- Analyze modulated signals
- Implement real-time signal processing on microcontrollers

Master these fundamentals, and MATLAB becomes your invisible collaborator in every measurement and design you undertake.
