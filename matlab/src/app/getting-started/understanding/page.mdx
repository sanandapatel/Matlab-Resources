# The MATLAB Environment

When you open MATLAB, you'll see four main areas:

**Command Window (Bottom Left)**: This is where MATLAB executes your commands immediately. You type a command and press Enter—MATLAB processes it and shows the result. This is perfect for quick calculations and testing individual lines of code.

**Editor (Center)**: This is where you write scripts (files with `.m` extension). Unlike the Command Window, a script allows you to write multiple lines of code, save them, and run them all at once. This is your primary workspace for DSP projects.

**Workspace (Top Right)**: This panel shows all variables currently in memory. Each variable has a name, size (dimensions), and data type. As you run code, variables appear here. You can inspect any variable by double-clicking it.

**Current Folder (Left Side)**: Shows the file structure. MATLAB can only access files in the current folder without explicitly changing the path. Always organize your DSP projects in a dedicated folder.
