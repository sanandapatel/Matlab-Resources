# Operators: Standard vs Element-Wise

One of the most common beginner mistakes is confusing `*` with `.*`.

```bash filename="operators.m" copy
clear all; clc;

% Scalar multiplication (both do the same thing)
x = [1, 2, 3];
y1 = 2 * x;      % [2, 4, 6] — scalar times vector
y2 = x .* 2;     % [2, 4, 6] — same result (order doesn't matter)

% Vector multiplication: matrix operation vs element-wise
a = [1, 2, 3];
b = [4, 5, 6];

% a * b' is matrix multiplication (results in scalar—dot product)
result1 = a * b';  % 1×3 × 3×1 = scalar = 32

% a .* b is element-wise multiplication (results in vector)
result2 = a .* b;  % [1×4, 2×5, 3×6] = [4, 10, 18]

% Division operations
dividend = [10, 20, 30];

result3 = dividend / 2;      % [5, 10, 15] — scalar division
result4 = dividend ./ 2;     % [5, 10, 15] — element-wise (same for scalars)

% Element-wise power
x = [1, 2, 3];
y1 = x .^ 2;     % [1, 4, 9] — each element squared
y2 = x ^ 2;      % ERROR for non-square vectors; only for square matrices

% These operations are essential in DSP when processing signals
frequency = [100, 200, 300];  % Hz
magnitude = [0.5, 0.3, 0.1];
power = magnitude .^ 2;       % Power in each frequency bin
```

**Explanation**: The dot (`.`) in `.*, ./, .^` means "element-wise." Without it, MATLAB tries to interpret as a matrix operation, which fails for non-square dimensions. In DSP, you almost always use element-wise operations on signal vectors.
