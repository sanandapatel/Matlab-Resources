# Common Beginner Mistakes and Debugging

### Mistake 1
Forgetting the Dot in Element-Wise Operations

```bash filename="file.m" copy
% WRONG
x = [1, 2, 3];
y = [4, 5, 6];
result = x * y;  % ERROR: Dimensions don't match for matrix multiplication

% CORRECT
result = x .* y;  % Element-wise: [4, 10, 18]
```

### Mistake 2
Using Wrong Indexing

```bash filename="file.m" copy
% WRONG
signal = [10, 20, 30];
first = signal(0);  % ERROR: MATLAB uses 1-based indexing

% CORRECT
first = signal(1);  % Returns 10
```

### Mistake 3
Dimension Mismatch in Operations

```bash filename="file.m" copy
% WRONG
time = 0:0.01:1;      % 101 samples (row vector)
freq = [100, 200];    % 2 frequencies (row vector)
x = sin(2*pi*freq*time);  % ERROR: (1×2) × (1×101) incompatible

% CORRECT
freq = [100; 200];    % Column vector (2×1)
x = sin(2*pi*freq*time);  % (2×1) × (1×101) = (2×101) — each row is a signal
```

### Debugging Tools

```bash filename="file.m" copy
% Use disp to print intermediate values
x = [1, 2, 3];
disp(['x = ', num2str(x)]);  % Shows: x = 1     2     3

% Check variable size and type
whos x;  % Shows size, type, and memory

% Use keyboard to pause execution and inspect variables
% (uncomment next line during debugging)
% keyboard;  % MATLAB pauses here; type variable names in Command Window

% Check for NaN (Not a Number) and Inf
result = sqrt(-1);  % NaN warning
filtered = result / 0;  % Inf

any_nan = any(isnan(result));  % Check if any NaN
any_inf = any(isinf(filtered));  % Check if any Inf
```

#### Explanation
`disp` prints values for inspection. `whos` shows variable details. `keyboard` halts execution, letting you examine variables interactively. `isnan` and `isinf` detect numerical problems. In DSP, you'll check for NaN (from invalid operations) and Inf (from division by zero).
