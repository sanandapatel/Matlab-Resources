# Scripts vs Functions vs Live Scripts

### Scripts (.m files)
A script is a plain text file containing MATLAB commands that execute sequentially. Scripts have no input/output specification—they use variables in the workspace directly.

```bash filename="basic_sine_wave.m" copy
% This script generates and plots a simple sine wave

fs = 8000;           % Sampling frequency in Hz
t = 0:1/fs:1;        % Time vector: 0 to 1 second, sampled at fs
f = 440;             % Frequency of sine wave (A4 note)
x = sin(2*pi*f*t);   % Generate sine wave

plot(t, x);
xlabel('Time (s)');
ylabel('Amplitude');
title('440 Hz Sine Wave');
grid on;
```

**Explanation**: `fs` defines how many samples per second (8000 samples/sec). The colon operator `0:1/fs:1` creates a time vector starting at 0, incrementing by 1/8000, ending at 1 second. `sin(2*pi*f*t)` computes the sine wave mathematically. The multiplication operator `*` here performs scalar multiplication across the entire vector.

### Functions (.m files with function declaration)
A function is a reusable block of code with inputs and outputs. Functions are essential for DSP because you'll apply the same operation repeatedly.

```bash filename="generate_sine_wave.m" copy
function [x, t] = generate_sine_wave(fs, duration, frequency)
    % Function: generate_sine_wave
    % Input:  fs (sampling frequency), duration (seconds), frequency (Hz)
    % Output: x (signal samples), t (time vector)
    
    t = 0:1/fs:duration-1/fs;  % Time vector from 0 to duration-1/fs
    x = sin(2*pi*frequency*t);  % Compute sine wave samples
end
```

**How to use this function**:
```bash filename="generate_sine_wave.m" copy
% In a script or Command Window
[signal, time_vector] = generate_sine_wave(8000, 2, 440);
% signal contains 16000 samples (8000 samples/sec × 2 seconds)
% time_vector contains the corresponding time values
```

**Explanation**: The function declaration `function [x, t] = generate_sine_wave(fs, duration, frequency)` tells MATLAB this function produces two outputs (`x, t`) and takes three inputs. Inside, we compute the time vector and signal. When you call the function, MATLAB returns these values.

### Live Scripts (.mlx files)
Live Scripts combine code, output, and formatted text in one interactive document. Perfect for learning because you see results immediately. However, for professional DSP work, regular scripts are more common.
