# Essential Startup Commands

Every MATLAB session should start with these cleanup commands:

```bash copy
clear all;   % Delete all variables from workspace
clc;         % Clear the Command Window (removes previous output)
close all;   % Close all figure windows
```

**Explanation**: `clear all` ensures you start with a clean workspace—no leftover variables from previous sessions. `clc` clears the screen for readability. `close all` closes all plots. These prevent subtle bugs where old data interferes with new calculations.
