# Control Flow: if–elseif–else

Conditional logic is essential for signal validation and branching in your DSP code.

```bash filename="control-flow.m" copy
clear all; clc;

% Simple if-else
signal_level = 2.5;

if signal_level > 3.0
    disp('Signal is high');
elseif signal_level > 1.0
    disp('Signal is medium');
else
    disp('Signal is low');
end

% Multiple conditions (AND: &&, OR: ||, NOT: ~)
fs = 8000;           % Sampling frequency
signal_duration = 2; % Seconds

if fs >= 8000 && signal_duration <= 10
    disp('Sampling rate is adequate for this duration');
end

% Practical DSP example: validate signal before processing
max_amplitude = max(abs([0.5, -1.2, 0.8, 1.5])); % Find peak

if max_amplitude > 1.0
    warning('Signal clipping detected!');
    normalized_signal = [0.5, -1.2, 0.8, 1.5] / max_amplitude;
else
    normalized_signal = [0.5, -1.2, 0.8, 1.5];
end
```

**Explanation**: The `if` block executes if the condition is true. Use `&&` (AND) for multiple conditions that must all be true, `||` (OR) if any condition must be true. The `~` operator means NOT. In DSP, you frequently check if a signal is within expected bounds before filtering.
