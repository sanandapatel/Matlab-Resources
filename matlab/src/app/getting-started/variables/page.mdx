# Variables and Data Types

MATLAB is dynamically typed—you don't declare types; MATLAB infers them from assignment.

### Numeric Data Types

```bash filename="variables.m" copy
clear all; clc;

% Double (64-bit floating point) — default for most DSP work
voltage = 3.3;           % Single value (scalar)
signal = [1.2, 3.4, 5.6]; % Vector of doubles
matrix = [1 2 3; 4 5 6]; % Matrix of doubles

% Check data type and memory
whos voltage signal matrix
% Output shows: voltage is 1×1 double (8 bytes)
%              signal is 1×3 double (24 bytes)
%              matrix is 2×3 double (48 bytes)

% Single (32-bit floating point) — uses half the memory
signal_single = single([1.2, 3.4, 5.6]); % Explicit conversion

% Integer types (useful for counters, indices, low-power DSP)
counter = int32(0);      % 32-bit signed integer (-2.1 billion to +2.1 billion)
byte_value = uint8(255); % 8-bit unsigned (0 to 255)
```

**Explanation**: By default, MATLAB uses `double` (8 bytes per number), which offers high precision but uses more memory. For embedded DSP (like your RF work), you'd use `single` to match 32-bit microcontroller arithmetic. `int32` and `uint8` are for counters or when working with microcontroller data that's stored as integers.

### Logical Data Type (Boolean)

```bash filename="variables.m" copy
% Logical: True (1) or False (0)
is_signal_valid = true;
is_frequency_high = false;
comparison_result = (5 > 3);  % Evaluates to true (1)

% Use in conditions
if is_signal_valid
    disp('Signal is valid');  % disp prints text to Command Window
end
```

**Explanation**: Logical values are used in conditional statements. The comparison `(5 > 3)` returns 1 (true) because it's mathematically correct.
